# FAL
Repository focused on algorithm design and formal analysis. 
It covers iterative and recursive patterns, divide and conquer strategies, and backtracking techniques, with an emphasis on formal verification and asymptotic efficiency.

This collection includes solved problems from the FAL (Fundamentos de Algoritmia) course, part of the Computer Engineering degree at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).
